# DataInBrief_Deamidation
This repository contains the R Script for calculating deamidation ratios from GPM outputs and the collated protein and peptide search results
as explained in Multari et al. 2022 Data In Brief. (link to paper will be added once published).

The folder 'Deamidate_DIB' conatins the input GPM peptide result files (.xlsx) for the R Script (deamidate_DIB.R) as well as example output files (.png).

'S1 Protein Results All Samples.xlsx' is an Excel workbook which contains the collated GPM Protein outputs from the paper with a 'Read Me' sheet at the
front explaining what each of the columns mean.

'S2 Peptide Results All Samples.xlsx' is an Excel workbook which contains the collated GPM Peptide outputs from the paper with a 'Read Me' sheet at the
front explaining what each of the columns mean. This workbook contains all peptide-to-spectrum matching outputs for this study including any identified
modifications. 

This Data in Brief paper is an accompaniment to the following Journal of Archaeological Science publication:
